I've been playing with the idea for some time and today I finally start my own blog.

You'll read about JavaScript, web technologies and solutions I came across developing web applications.

 The blog is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and
 hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). You can find the repo at
 [zemirco.github.io](https://github.com/zeMirco/zemirco.github.io). I got the domain
 [mircozeiss.com](http://www.mircozeiss.com) from [Hetzner](http://www.hetzner.de/en/) and, being
 a developer and not a designer, I'm very thankful for [Lucas Lew](http://lucaslew.com/) who
 created the [whitespace](https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace) theme.

If you've got some ideas for improvements send me an email to
[mirco.zeiss@gmail.com](mailto:mirco.zeiss@gmail.com) or write something below.
